# OrbTracer

This project's aim is to solve the following questions:

 - what would a half transparent, light emitting sphere look like from the outside?
 - what would said sphere look like from the inside?
 - how does the result differ if the light emission would purely originate from a second sphere 1/10th of the size, positioned exactly in the center of the outer sphere?

We aim to simulate this behaviour with a simple raytracer, written in WebGL 2 / GLSL ES v300, hosted inside a JavaScript enabled web page.
