## Overview & Setup
This project serves as a quick start for WebGL. A simple shader and OBJ loader are included, as well as a random colored monkey object. In order to use the code, GL-Matrix is needed. Simply use the provided `git submodule` to automatically download the newest version. There are no other dependencies.

## WebGL & GLSL Version
The project uses WebGL2 by default. However, an alternative code line for WebGL1 is included. The provided vertex and fragment shaders use GLSL v1.0. A future alternative for v3.0 is planned.
